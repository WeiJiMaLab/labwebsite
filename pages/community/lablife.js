    <h2>Lab culture and expectations</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The lab has an open and collaborative culture. We help each other and
        try to make the lab (and the broader community) better. Wei Ji tries -
        not always successfully - to be accessible and to listen well. We talk
        about problems. We value social life and organize many activities with
        the lab, including dinners, board game nights, Escape the Rooms, and
        karaoke. Once a year, we have a lab retreat with a mix of work and fun.

      <h3>Weiji's personal story</h3>

          Weiji is very open about his personal story, including struggles and
          failures. For example,

          Peipei, who has side aspirations as a documentary film maker, made a

      <h3>Community</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Wei Ji strongly encourages you to be active in the community, for
          example through outreach (e.g.{" "}
          <a href="http://www.nogn-nyu.com">
            Neuroscience Outreach Group at NYU
          </a>
          ) or policy/advocacy (e.g.{" "}
          <a href="http://www.scaan.net">
            Scientist Action and Advocacy Network
          </a>
          ). See the <a href="community.html">Community page</a> for more
          information.

  <div>
    <h2>Mentorship in the lab</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Direct mentorship</h3>
      <p>
        The lab does not have a hierarchical structure: it is easy to talk to
        Wei Ji one on one. One-on-one meetings can be devoted to discussing
        research, professional development (such as career planning), or more
        personal topics, such as how to stay motivated, insecurities, or what it
        is all for. If you want, you can schedule a weekly meeting with Wei Ji,
        or even twice a week, but walk-ins are also encouraged and Wei Ji will
        himself come chat regularly. If you are a PhD student, you will be
        mentored directly by Wei Ji, although sometimes in collaboration with a
        postdoc. If you are a Masters-level or undergraduate student, you will
        be mentored directly by Wei Ji, although sometimes in collaboration with
        a postdoc or PhD student. Mentorship is ideally customized for each lab
        member, and this requires an open, two-way communication about what
        works and what doesn't work. For example, would you rather have Wei Ji
        set deadlines or set your own? How frequently do you want to meet? Wei
        Ji is open to receiving feedback on his mentorship, and will make
        changes in response to feedback.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>If problems arise</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          If you are a PhD student, you will have a committee of other
          professors, who will listen to and act upon any concerns or
          disagreements you might have about Wei Ji's mentorship; the other
          important resource is the Director of Graduate Studies.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Lab meetings</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Lab meeting is once a week for 1.5 hours. We usually start with a
          "stand-up round", in which everyone summarizes what they have done in
          the past week and what they are struggling with. This is also a moment
          to ask for help. Then, a lab member might present plans or results
          from their project. We also do writing workshops and presentation
          practices. Moreover, we regularly discuss academic practices, habits,
          and feelings; recent topics have included the role of perfectionism,
          the role of competition, and the role of creativity in academia. From
          time to time, we also discuss the evolution of scientific ideas within
          the lab - to get a bigger picture and identify blind spots. Once or
          twice a week, we have "working together sessions", because we find
          them motivating.

          is a mentorship series founded and managed by Wei Ji. In each event,
          one faculty member shares their life story, with a focus on struggles,
          failures, doubts, detours, and weaknesses. Common topics include
          dealing with expectations (your own and others), impostor syndrome,
          procrastination, the role of luck, rejection, and conflicts with
          advisors, but these topics are always embedded in the speaker's
          broader narrative. We also feature speakers who have left academia -
          e.g. academic editors, data scientists, and even a screenwriter.

        Weiji's lab accepts PhD students from both the Neuroscience Graduate
        Program and from the Cognition and Perception Program. The former has a
        rotation system (so you get admitted by the program, not by a PI), the
        latter does not (so Weiji would have to accept you). The{" "}

        Dongqi Bao (a lab alumna) and a group of Chinese students wrote a{" "}

        </a>{" "}
        (in Chinese). It includes experiences about early-stage preparation,
        finding research positions abroad, networking, choosing programs,
        preparing material and interviews, etc.

    <div>
      <h3>Career planning</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Wei Ji encourages PhD students and postdocs to explore career options
          both inside and outside academia. PhD students in the lab often do an
          internship in industry at some point during their PhD. Everyone in the
          lab fills out an{" "}
          <a href="https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/">
            Individual Development Plan
          </a>{" "}
          and discusses it with Weiji.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Conferences</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          PhD students and postdocs may attend one conference a year (even if
          they have no work to present). They may attend a second conference if
          they have work to present and funding allows. Which conferences to
          attend is a joint decision with Wei Ji. Conferences that lab members
          have attended include Cognitive Science Society, Cognitive
          Computational Neuroscience (CCN), Reinforcement Learning and Decision
          Making, Computational and Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne), Vision
          Sciences Society (VSS), Society for Neuroscience (SfN), Society for
          Neuroeconomics, Psychonomics, and the Society for Mathematical
          Psychology. PhD students may participate in a summer school at least
          once during their tenure.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Mentoring others</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          PhD students and postdocs get mentorship opportunities of their own:
          you can mentor a Masters student, an undergraduate, a high school
          student, or if you are a postdoc, a PhD student. The lab has so far
          mentored four students from high schools in the New York City area.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Grantwriting</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Some students and postdocs write their own grant applications, but Wei
          Ji usually does not require this, and some grant opportunities are
          limited to U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
