        is a mentorship series co-founded and led by Wei Ji. In each event, one
        faculty member shares their life story, with a focus on struggles,
        failures, doubts, detours, and weaknesses. Common topics include dealing
        with expectations (your own and others), impostor syndrome,
        procrastination, the role of luck, rejection, and conflicts with advisors,
        but these topics are always embedded in the speaker's broader narrative.
        We also feature speakers who have left academia - e.g. academic editors,
        data scientists, and even a screenwriter. The series has themed events on
        mentorship, anti-racism, work-life balance, and other topics.

        ScAAN scientists provide pro bono science consultation to social causes,

        ongoing campaigns of social change organizations by writing knowledge
        briefs for lay audiences and by visualizing or analyzing data. Besides
        Will, many lab members and alumni have played a role in ScAAN: Jenn Laura
        Lee is a founding member and president, Wei Ji is a founding member and
        project leader, and Andra and Maija are active members. Wei Ji and Jenn
