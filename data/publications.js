        description: `Humans procrastinate, but why? One long-standing hypothesis is that temporal discounting drives procrastination: in a task with a distant future reward, the discounted future reward fails to provide sufficient motivation to initiate work early. However, empirical evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we used a long-term real-world task to measure procrastination; critically, we measured the entire time course of work progress instead of only completion time, allowing us to compute a fine-grained metric of procrastination. We found a positive correlation between individuals' degree of future reward discounting and their level of procrastination, suggesting that temporal discounting is a cognitive mechanism underlying procrastination.`,

        description: `When I had just started my NYU job in 2013, I pitched a project to incoming Ph.D. students. It was a wild new direction for me: using board games to understand how people think ahead. Bas van Opheusden took on the challenge. Have you ever wondered what makes chess grandmasters so good at the game? The science of expertise in chess is almost 75 years old, starting with Adriaan de Groot's beautiful [PhD thesis](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1948-01090-000). De Groot, and later Simon & Chase, linked chess expertise to pattern recognition. But what about thinking ahead? Could it be that experts are better because they plan further into the future? It's complicated. [Some studies](https://content.iospress.com/articles/icga-journal/icg27403) support deeper planning by chess experts, some don't. We believe the problem is the complexity of chess. Building computational models for human chess play is really hard, so studies mostly use verbal reports. We tried to find a game that's simpler than chess, but complex enough that planning 5-6 steps into the future is sometimes necessary. Our answer: four-in-a-row, a variant of tic-tac-toe and Go-Moku (五子棋). Four-in-a-row turned out to be the perfect paradigm. The rules are easy but it's remarkably fun, and calculating multiple moves ahead pays off. Play against the computer [here](https://weijimalab.github.io/four_in_a_row/try_experiments.html). We collected data from people playing 4-in-a-row against each other or against custom-designed computer opponents. We had to develop [new statistical methods](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008483) to fit our computational models, and run the computer cluster for an insane amount of time. We found a robust increase in planning depth with expertise. Also in the paper: eye tracking, a time pressure manipulation, and replication in large-scale naturalistic data. Thanks to Bas, we have also started lots of collaborations based on this paradigm.`,

Decision-making researchers, on the other hand, have concluded that the criterion does adjust to account for sensory uncertainty, including under inattention. We try to reconcile these perspectives.`,

        description: `Bayesian optimal inference is often heralded as a principled, general framework for human perception. However, optimal inference requires integration over all possible world states, which quickly becomes intractable in complex real-world settings. Additionally, deviations from optimal inference have been observed in human decisions. As a candidate alternative framework to address these issues, we propose point estimate observers, which evaluate only a single best estimate of the world state per response category. We compare the predicted behavior of these model observers to human decisions in five perceptual categorisation tasks. Compared to the Bayesian observer, the point estimate observer loses decisively in one task, ties in two and wins in two tasks. Thus, the point estimate observer is competitive with the Bayesian observer and should be considered in future model development and experimental studies.`,

We did not use a proxy task such as proprioceptive drift or reaching error, but direct "detection-like" judgment of illusion elicitation. By manipulating visual noise, we showed that participants are taking trial-to-trial sensory uncertainty into account to make their judgment about body ownership. We compared different versions of the model for body ownership and synchrony judgment tasks and found interesting differences and similarities across the two types of tasks.`,

For example, optimal inference about whether a common cause exists based on N spatially distributed visual items requires marginalizing over both the location of the latent cause and 2N possible affiliation patterns (where each item may be affiliated or non-affiliated with the latent cause).

        description: `Neural representations of visual working memory (VWM) are noisy, and thus, decisions based on VWM are inevitably subject to uncertainty. However, the mechanisms by which the brain simultaneously represents the content and uncertainty of memory remain largely unknown. Here, inspired by the theory of probabilistic population codes, we test the hypothesis that the human brain represents an item maintained in VWM as a probability distribution over stimulus feature space, thereby capturing both its content and uncertainty. We used a neural generative model to decode probability distributions over memorized locations from fMRI activation patterns. We found that the mean of the probability distribution decoded from retinotopic cortical areas predicted memory reports on a trial-by-trial basis. Moreover, in several of the same mid-dorsal stream areas the spread of the distribution predicted subjective trial-by-trial uncertainty judgments. These results provide evidence that VWM content and uncertainty are jointly represented by probabilistic neural codes.`,

        description: `Many models (not limited to psychology and neuroscience) don't have a log-likelihood in closed form, but we can easily sample observations from the model. When you fit such a simulated (sampled) model using ML estimation, do you ever encounter log(0), and then replace that by log(some small number) so that your code runs? I used to do that all the time. Bad idea!! A few years ago, Bas van Opheusden explained to me that this inevitably leads to biases, because log(true probability) can go all the way to negative infinity, whereas log(small number) cannot. And this is just one symptom. Even if you don't run into log(0) issues, the log(proportion of samples) estimator ("fixed sampling") is biased no matter what. To fix the issue, Bas reinvented what turned out to be an old method by the statistician De Groot (1959). Basic idea: you sample UNTIL you obtain the observed outcome, and use HOW LONG IT TOOK YOU, plugging that into an equation. This gives a uniformly unbiased estimate of the log likelihood. Bas worked with Luigi on computational improvements to reduce variance, interfacing with parameter optimization, and applications. None of this applies if you have an analytical expression for the log likelihood, but sadly, most interesting computational models are not of that type.`,

        description: `Visual search, the task of detecting or locating target items amongst distractor items in a visual scene, is an important function for animals and humans. Different theoretical accounts make differing predictions for the effects of distractor statistics. Here we use a task in which we parametrically vary distractor items, allowing for a simultaneously fine-grained and comprehensive study of distractor statistics. We found effects of target-distractor similarity, distractor variability, and an interaction between the two, although the effect of the interaction on performance differed from the one expected. To explain these findings, we constructed computational process models that make trial-by-trial predictions for behaviour based on the full set of stimuli in a trial. These models, including a Bayesian observer model, provided excellent accounts of both the qualitative and quantitative effects of distractor statistics, as well as of the effect of changing the statistics of the environment (in the form of distractors being drawn from a different distribution). We conclude with a broader discussion of the role of computational process models in the understanding of visual search.`,

        description: `A Bayesian approach to collinearity detection, which you could call a simple form of perceptual organization. We focus on the effects of uncertainty as controlled by retinal eccentricity. Yanli started this work as an undergraduate research assistant in 2015, continued while a Masters student in Data Science, and finished while (now) a PhD student in Data Science. Luigi started it as a first-year postdoc in the lab, did another postdoc since, and is now faculty at the University of Helsinki. This is how long papers can take (the pandemic may have made it longer than normal). But I enjoyed the process, especially because Yanli kept energetically coming back to the project even though revisions were spaced far apart and she had moved on. I would say that the work falls into the category of "Bayesian models of slightly more interesting perceptual computations". The Bayesian poster children of combining a likelihood with a prior, and cue combination are nowadays interesting only for their new applications, not for their complications. Closely related work from the lab: Shaiyan Keshvari's and Aspen Yoo's work on change detection. The parallel is that change detection involves changes across time and collinearity detection involves changes across space (behind an occluder). A difference is that uncertainty was controlled through shape there and through eccentricity here (shape wouldn't make much sense for collinearity detection). Also related: Ronald van den Berg's work on sameness judgment, but that focused on set size and not uncertainty.`,

I started wondering about the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. Coming from perception, my first question was about (deviations from) optimality, but there did not seem to be a whole lot on that. Mingyu started on this project in April 2015, and Zahy joined in October 2015. We tried to do a clean experiment, without too many complicating factors. Shortly after, we heard about a 2011 CogSci paper by Ke Sang, Peter Todd, and Robert Goldstone, but fortunately there were enough interesting questions for two groups to have very similar approaches. Please also check out their latest preprint here. As to Mingyu and Zahy's paper, it took 3 years and 10 months from the start of the work to publication; an interesting fact is that Mingyu was a primary lab member only during the summer of 2015, which might have made the timeline a little longer than average.

In the end, 43 pages and a giant negative result, but new methods for model comparison. We set out to detect one of my babies (variable precision) in perception (rather than in visual working memory). But we wanted to do thorough model comparison, in the style of Luigi Acerbi, Ronald van den Berg, Jan Drugowitsch, Valentin Wyart etc. But... the more factors we included (lapses, decision noise, oblique effect), the less evidence remained for 'pure' variable precision (e.g. due to attentional fluctuations). But I'm actually quite happy, as it means that as long you include those factors in your model, you might not need variable precision. Open question: is the situation the same in visual working memory (as suggested by Mike Pratte and Frank Tong in 2017)? Take-home message: think twice before you start working with me!",

In this project, primatologist James P. Higham acted as the PI and I as the PhD student. It was absolutely exhilarating! James taught me a lot about monkey mating behavior and provided the big picture of the project. I did the math and the coding, and of course that came with familiar feelings of dread about bugs being left in my code. The only reason I could even contribute was because at a computational level, inferring ovulation time from observations of facial color is not that different from less naturalistic forms of perception that are my lab's bread and butter. So yes, it is possible to have your own side projects as a PI, and those side projects often make life interesting, especially if they are forays into neighboring fields. And academia is perfect for continuing to learn actively throughout your career.`,

This is related to work by Rosanne Rademaker and Frank Tong, and to our own work with Maija Honig and Daryl Fougnie. We are now using this paradigm for a neuroimaging study, with Tommy Sprague and Masih Rahmati.`,

        description: `Everybody knows that confidence ratings are Bayesian. Except that nobody really knows, because very few papers compare against alternatives! Wouldn't it be nice to have qualitative signatures of Bayesian confidence in behavioral data? This was the bold idea of Balazs Hangya and Joshua Sanders in Adam Kepecs' lab (Neural Computation and Neuron, 2016). Will was intrigued and dug into the details. For two signatures, we identified conditions that seem rather constraining, and we try to dissect those here. Moreover, last year, Joaquin Navajas working with Bahador Bahrami proposed a separate "X-pattern" or "divergence" signature. It looks the same as one of Hangya et al., but it turns out not to be, and it doesn't seem either necessary or sufficient for confidence to be Bayesian :-(
        and I conclude here that, tragically but not unexpectedly, there might be no shortcut to quantitative model comparison (of course on top of clever experiments). The jury is still out on whether confidence ratings are Bayesian. In the meantime, we want to thank Hangya, Sanders, Kepecs, and Navajas for being very open to discussing the pros and cons of their measures. This was not a given, since they knew we were going to write this critical paper.`,

We introduce a task that is at its core perceptual categorization of a 1d stimulus, but with both a spatial switching and a feature switching component. In addition, we aimed to bring out executive control deficits by allowing participants to press one of 8 buttons. All 8 are used in the task but on a given trial, only 2 are relevant. ADHD participants had both higher perceptual variability and higher "task-irrelevant motor output". In addition, those were correlated with each other. Based on the perceptual variability parameter alone, we could already classify participants as ADHD vs control with 77% accuracy. ADHD is not my field but I found this remarkably high. The high cognitive load might be necessary to bring out the perceptual deficits.`,

However, behavioral models have many plausible tweaks (e.g. observer assumptions, heteroskedasticity, decision noise), and when we allowed for those, the models became less distinguishable. Thus, the story became more methodological: how to comprehensively compare models of multisensory perception. Then, two remarkable things happened: (1) @AcerbiLuigi and Kalpana stubbornly kept working on it, even though the message was now less sexy; (2) The PLoS Computational Biology reviewers and editor saw the merits of such a methodological contribution. Remarkable because in my experience, methodological rigor often loses out to sexy messaging. For example, authors present only one favored model, without any comparison, or they consider only a bare-bones version of each model. Comparing more models rarely makes a conclusion crisper, but almost always makes it more appropriately nuanced.`,

        description: `Computational models in fields such as computational neuroscience are often evaluated via stochastic simulation or numerical approximation. Fitting these models implies a difficult optimization problem over complex, possibly noisy parameter landscapes. Bayesian optimization (BO) has been successfully applied to solving expensive black-box problems in engineering and machine learning. Here we explore whether BO can be applied as a general tool for model fitting. First, we present a novel hybrid BO algorithm, Bayesian adaptive direct search (BADS), that achieves competitive performance with an affordable computational overhead for the running time of typical models. We then perform an extensive benchmark of BADS vs. many common and state-of-the-art nonconvex, derivative-free optimizers, on a set of model-fitting problems with real data and models from six studies in behavioral, cognitive, and computational neuroscience. With default settings, BADS consistently finds comparable or better solutions than other methods, including ‘vanilla’ BO, showing great promise for advanced BO techniques, and BADS in particular, as a general model-fitting tool.`,

Specifically, we model a metacognitive process where evaluating candidate actions is viewed as gaining noisy measurements of the value of each action. This statistical estimate is then combined with prior experience in a Bayesian manner to decide whether and in which direction to continue sampling. This Bayesian meta-planner makes intuitive predictions across a range of parameters and acts as a more valuable, informed method for guiding search when compared to best-first and breadth-first search. Additionally, the meta-planner qualitatively accounts for response time trends in a complex planning task.`,

Researchers try to establish that the neural response is (1) sensitive and (2) specific to the feature, (3) invariant to other features, and (4) functional, which means that it is used downstream in the brain. We formalize these desiderata in information-theoretic terms. This formalism allows us to precisely state the desiderata while unifying the different analysis methods used in neuroscience under one framework. We discuss how common methods such as correlational analyses, decoding and encoding models, representational similarity analysis, and tests of statistical dependence are used to evaluate the desiderata. In doing so, we provide a common terminology to researchers that helps to clarify disagreements, to compare and integrate results across studies and research groups, and to identify when evidence might be missing and when evidence for some representational conclusion is strong.`,

        description: `Search in visual working memory (VWM) is an important process in everyday life, but it has so far not been investigated sufficiently using psychophysical and computational approaches. Here, we examine whether computational process models from the study of VWM and of visual search also apply to search in VWM. Participants performed a two-alternative VWM-based color localization task in which set size and color similarity were varied. We tested models with a resource-limited encoding stage and a Bayesian decision stage. We found that a variable-precision model fit the data well and that adding an item limit did not improve the fit. Next, we took a resource-rational approach, in which mean precision at each set size is set by optimizing a combination between behavioral performance and encoding cost. We found that a resource-rational model with an ad-hoc cost function captures behavior well, but not better than the best non-resource-rational model. Our results, albeit unsurprising, contribute to the evidence that search in VWM is very similar to search in perception.`,

        description: `We use a complex planning task and a computational modeling framework to delineate the developmental trajectories of three component processes of complex planning. Participants (ages 8-25 years) played the Four-in-a-row task, presented as a 4x9 board game, against computer opponents. We found asynchronous age-related change in the component processes of complex planning, with the heuristic evaluation of relevant features rapidly improving from childhood into adolescence, and planning depth showing more protracted developmental improvements. Fewer attentional oversights predicted better planning but did not demonstrate age-related variability. These results provide evidence for the continued development of model-based decision strategies into adulthood, and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underpinning planning ability within complex environments at different developmental stages.`,

Interference could happen at a sensory level (signals getting mixed), at the decision stage, or the distractor could get substituted for the target. We take inspiration from the visual crowding literature, which has done a great job in distinguishing sources of interference. We use a 2-back task with orientations instead of letters or numbers. We formulate a model for each level of interference, then compare the models. We cannot distinguish all models but hopefully it is a start.`,

This tradition has mostly focused on homogeneous distractors, which are not very realistic. In a different tradition, Duncan and Humphreys (1989) conducted a landmark study on visual search with heterogeneous distractors. However, they used complex stimuli, making modeling and dissociation of component processes difficult. Here, we attempt to unify these research traditions by systematically examining visual search with heterogeneous distractors using simple, parametric stimuli and Bayesian modeling.`,
